        <h3>Whats our limits (Recommended Reading)</h3>
        <p>At our company, we specialize in building and designing custom websites that align perfectly with your brand image and specific requirements. While our goal is to create stunning websites, it's important to note that we do not frequently code any back-end on our websites. We primarily use back-end for analytics or simple functions that a website must have. Additionally, we do not offer custom domains but instead use Github pages. Every website we create will have the .github.io domain, for example: https://mywebsite.github.io.

Please note that we only create proprietary websites for niche markets, and we do not create any illegal or inappropriate content such as pornography, hitman sites, etc.</p>

        <h3>Budget</h3>
        <p>At Webworx, we understand that every business has different needs, goals, and budget requirements when it comes to their website. That's why we offer a range of pricing options to suit various budgets, starting from a minimum of $120/1200kr per month and going up to $30k or more per month for more complex and extensive websites.

Our pricing is based on several factors, including the size and complexity of the website, the number of pages, and the amount of custom development required. We work closely with our clients to identify their specific needs and requirements and provide them with a tailored solution that meets their budget constraints.</p>
